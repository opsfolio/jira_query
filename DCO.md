## What is the DCO?

The DCO is a certification normally associated with every contribution to a project made by every contributor. It signifies that the contributor has the right to submit the contribution under the applicable open source license of the project. The entire certification text (maintained by the Linux Foundation as version 1.1 at https://developercertificate.org/) is the following:

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
 
(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or
 
(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or
 
(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.
 
(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.
